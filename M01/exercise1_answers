What is an algorithm?
=> an algorithm is a step-by-step process to finish a task or solve a problem. Algorithms are written in short and concise sentences so it is easy to comprehend. Algorithms must have "start/begin" as the first step and "stop/end" as the last step.

Here's a simple example of an algorithm to cook instant soup noodles:
1. Start
2. Boil water
3. Open the packaging of instant soup noodles
4. Separate the seasoning and the raw noodles
5. If the boiled water is already hot, put the raw noodles inside the pot
6. Stir the noodles in the pot with a chopstick or a fork
7. Put all the seasonings into a bowl
8. If the noodles are already cooked, pour the noodles and water inside the bowl
9. Mix the noodles and the seasoning evenly
10. End

EXERCISE 1
==========

part a
1. Start
2. Input the values of the assignment score (X), midterm exam score (Y), and final exam score (Z)
3. Final Grade (FG) = (0.4) * X + (0.3) * Y + (0.3) * Z
4. Output FG
5. End

part b
1. Start
2. Input the total semesters that Mike has finished (S)
3. If s = 7 or s = 8, then output "Mike has graduated university on time"
4. Else, output "Mike has not graduated university on time"
5. End

part c
1. Start
2. Input the values of the starting number (S), the difference (D), and the amount of numbers in the progression (N)
3. Make an empty array (L)
4. Add S into L
5. S = S + D, then add S into L. Repeat until L has N numbers in it.
6. Output L
7. End

==========================================================================================

why do you abbreviate some phrases into 1-2 letters?
=> That is called a variable. A variable is used to store a value. In the case of exercise 1a, we need the values of the assignment score, midterm exam score, and the final exam score for this algorithm. So, we use X to store the value of the assignment score; Y to store the midterm exam score; and Z to store the value of the final exam score. And after calculating the values of X, Y, and Z with the formula, we store it into the FG variable. 

e.g. say a student has the assignment score of 70, midterm score of 85, and final exam score of 67. Calculate their final grade.
X = 70, Y = 85, Z = 67
FG = (0.4) * 70 + (0.3) * 85 + (0.3) * 67
FG = 73.6
So the final grade of this particular student is 73.6

what is S = S + D?
=> S = S + D means that the NEW value of S is the OLD value of S plus D. e.g. S = 3 and D = 5. So the NEW value of S is now S = 3 + 5 = 8. 

4 common types of data
- integer = a whole number, e.g. 14
- string = a collection of characters, e.g. "hello"
- float = decimals, e.g. 15.6
- boolean = true/false
