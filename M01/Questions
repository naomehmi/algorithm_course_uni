EXERCISE 1
==========

Make an algorithm to:
a. calculate the final grade (FG) of a student with their assignment score (X), midterm exam score (Y), and final exam score (Z) with this formula: FG = (0.4) * X + (0.3) * Y + (0.3) * Z.
b. decide whether Mike will graduate university on time or not. The condition to graduating on time is if Mike finishes university for 7 or 8 semester.
c. Mike has just studied about beautiful mathematical progression. A mathematical progression is said to be beautiful if it starts from a number S, and each adjacent number has the difference of D, and
the progression has N integer numbers. Help Mike make a beautiful mathematical progression that is in accordance with the input of N.

EXERCISE 2
==========

Make a computer code for each algorithm in exercise 1.
