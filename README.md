# algorithm_course_uni

This repository contains my code for my 2nd semester algorithms course in uni. I decided to do all the exercises from scratch again to practice and challenge my understanding of algorithms.

## brief description

- each folder represents every topic for this course, and contains my solutions for the exercises during the meeting.
- the formats of each code is straighforward. The objective of the task is commented at the top of the code, meanwhile the time complexity is commented at the bottom
- I might add a step-by-step explanation to every code later once I have finished all the topics
